Guidelines for Trial and Discount Offers [Doc C5]

Objective: Strategic use of discounts to encourage immediate conversion without harming profitability.

Trial Period: A 30-day, no-obligation trial can be offered on smaller insurance products (like critical illness coverage). This is available for leads who are still undecided.

Referral Discount: Leads referred by existing customers are eligible for a 15% discount on the first month's premium.

Aggressive Discount (At-Risk Leads): A discount of up to 25% on the first month is permitted only when there is a risk of losing the lead to a specific competitor (document the competitor's name in the system). Avoid setting a precedent with overly high "compensation."
